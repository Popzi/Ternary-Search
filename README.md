# Ternary search algorithm

This was written in the course Algorithms and Softwaredesign.
The task was to implement a ternary search algorithm and calculate its time complexity (in the source code).


I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)
